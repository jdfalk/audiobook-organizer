description: Database design advisor for the audiobook-organizer codebase. Answers "how should I store X?" questions in a way that is consistent with existing schema decisions (PebbleDB key conventions, NutsDB activity log patterns, SQLite opt-in tier). Works generically on other projects when context docs are absent.

# Database Design Advisor

## Setup

Invoke the `project-context` skill first, then read `docs/database-architecture.md` and `docs/database-pebble-schema.md` if they exist.

## Decision framework for this repo

Before proposing any new storage, answer:

1. **Is this a single k:v value or a keyed collection?** Single values go as a top-level PebbleDB key. Collections need a key-prefix scheme.
2. **Does it need to be queried by secondary keys?** PebbleDB is key-prefix only — if you need "find by author" you need either a secondary index (separate key) or an in-memory index.
3. **Is it append-only / time-series?** NutsDB (`activity.nutsdb`) is for the activity log — don't put operational data there.
4. **Is it relational with many joins?** SQLite is the opt-in alternative — but default to PebbleDB first and only escalate if needed.

## PebbleDB key conventions

Follow the existing patterns in `docs/database-pebble-schema.md`:
- Keys are `<prefix>:<id>` or `<prefix>:<secondary>:<primary>` for secondary indexes
- Version-suffix backfill flags: `<flag>_v3_done` (always include version suffix)
- Scan with prefix iterator, never scan full keyspace

## Cached aggregate pattern

For slow aggregate queries (counts, sums over large collections):
- Store a single k:v cache key with a dirty flag
- Set dirty on writes, recompute lazily on read
- Add a min-recompute interval (env var) to prevent thrashing
- This pattern is already used for library counts — see `stats:library` key

## What NOT to do

- Do not add a new top-level table or collection without reading existing schema first
- Do not use PebbleDB for relational data that needs multi-column queries — use SQLite
- Do not store full API response objects in cache (root cause of the 69GB memory bloat incident)
