## 🔮 Needs Serious Planning — Open Audiobook Acoustic-Fingerprint Index (a community-owned "AcoustID for audiobooks")

> Captured 2026-06-13. **Not yet specced — needs a dedicated brainstorming → spec session.**
> Related: [`docs/specs/2026-06-13-dedup-tuning-dataset-design.md`](docs/specs/2026-06-13-dedup-tuning-dataset-design.md)

**Vision.** MusicBrainz/AcoustID model audiobooks poorly (their DB is song/recording-based; a 9-hour book is not a "recording"). Build our own, better, **community-usable** index of audiobook acoustic fingerprints + verified identity (title/author/series/narrator/edition). It should be good enough that submitting back to AcoustID becomes unnecessary.

**Why a Git repo as the store (the constraint that shapes everything).** No public server, no hosting budget. A **GitHub repository + GitHub Actions is free, durable, and world-pullable**:
- **Disaster recovery:** if our prod data is wiped, the organizer rehydrates its identity layer by pulling the repo — the index lives outside our box.
- **Distribution:** anyone can clone it and skip the manual fingerprint/identify work we do today.
- **Provenance:** every record change is a reviewable commit/PR — human-verified records are auditable.

**Open design questions for the planning session:**
- **Format** — a sane, diffable, version-controlled on-disk layout (sharded JSON/JSONL by fingerprint-prefix? Parquet? a checked-in SQLite/Pebble snapshot artifact?). Must stay mergeable (avoid giant single files that conflict). Possibly a parallel **AI-queryable representation** (embeddings / structured docs) so the index can be asked natural-language questions.
- **The PR-bot loop** — a process that emits **PRs of new human-verified records**, and **CI workflows that validate (schema, dedup, no-regression) and apply** them to the canonical index. Bounded batch sizes, signed/attributed records, conflict resolution rules.
- **Identity unit** — what a "record" keys on (whole-book signature from `internal/fingerprint/book_signature.go` + part fingerprints + metadata), and how editions/abridgements/re-narrations are represented.
- **Trust & governance** — who can merge, how bad records are challenged/reverted, license (so the world can actually use it).
- **Relationship to AcoustID submission** — likely **supersedes** it; keep submission as an optional downstream export, not a dependency.

- `FileWholeFingerprint(path)` extraction (no seek, no offsets)
- Middle-80% similarity compare (suppresses Audible intros/outros)
- `synthesizeBookSignatureForBook` switched to partial-coverage synth
- Memdb strip of the new fingerprint bytes (RSS protection)

**Post-deploy actions for this PR:**

  `build-mode: none` instead of unsupported `autobuild`.
- [x] Restore this repo's reusable CodeQL language matrix to
  `["go", "javascript", "actions"]` and remove the local JavaScript CodeQL
  workaround.
- [x] Verified fixed by Security run `26727789014`.

**Follow-up PRs (not in this PR):**
- [x] **Step 3 — LSH index for whole-file similarity.** ✅ F5-T012 + T013 (Jun 10): `fpidx:<subfp>:<bookfile_id>` Pebble secondary index + build op; LSH probe collector replaces O(N) `ACOUSTID_FUZZY_ENABLED` path.

- [ ] **Online AcoustID lookup.** Whole-file fps can now be POSTed
  to `acoustid.org` for MBID enrichment — wire it up as an
  optional enrichment step after fingerprinting.

## 🚀 Followups from May 28, 2026 perf sprint

Today shipped 10 PRs (#1147-#1155) fixing the 67GB OOM, slow filtered
queries (4m→100ms), 500-per-page (3m51s→241ms), and the registry
double-dispatch + acoustid.scan subprocess bug. The fixes left a tail
of cleanup and proper-implementation work. Each task below is sized
for a small model (~30 min, single-file scope, clear acceptance test).

### MAYDEPLOY-A: Wire subprocess child-mode handler in main.go
`Isolate: true` on operation defs is currently disabled (PR #1155)
because the subprocess child-mode handler is never wired into
`main.go`. Without it, the child process re-execs with
`--operation-runner` and cobra root errors out with "unknown flag".

- [ ] **A1** [hold] `main.go`: before `cmd.Execute`, call
  `registry.IsChildMode()`. If true, build a minimal Registry with all
  plugin defs (NO server init, NO memdb warm — just defs + store
  access), then call `registry.RunChildMode(r)` which never returns.
  Acceptance: `audiobook-organizer --operation-runner <opID>` with
  `UOS_SOCKET=/tmp/sock` connects to a parent socket and runs.
- [ ] **A2** Add unit test in `internal/operations/registry/subprocess_test.go`
  that re-execs the test binary as child and verifies handshake +
  result roundtrip via the unix socket. (`testscript` or
  `os/exec.Cmd` with `os.Args[0]`.)
- [ ] **A3** [hold] After A1+A2 pass in CI, revert `Isolate: false` on the
  7 ops (PR #1155). Restore the original comments. Verify
  acoustid.scan logs both parent "dispatched" AND child stdout
  routed through reporter.

### MAYDEPLOY-B: Dedup UX hardening (today's logs)
The merge button hits TWO endpoints per click, and stale candidate
rows reference merged-away book IDs.

- [x] **B1** Find which frontend component fires both
  `POST /api/v1/audiobooks/merge` AND
  `POST /api/v1/dedup/candidates/:id/merge` for one Merge click
  (likely `web/src/components/dedup/`). Pick one endpoint, remove
  the other call.
- [x] **B2** `server/dedup_handlers.go:mergeDedupCandidate`: when
  `mergeService.MergeBooks` returns "book not found", respond 409
  Conflict with body `{status: "already_merged"}` instead of 500.
- [x] **B3** Add `cleanupCandidatesForMergedBook(bookID)` to
  `internal/dedup/engine.go`: when a book is merged-away, mark
  ALL other candidate rows referencing that book ID as "merged" so
  they disappear from the pending-candidates list. Call from
  `mergeService.MergeBooks` after the book is gone.
- [x] **B4** `embeddingStore.ListCandidates`: filter out rows whose
  `entity_a_id` or `entity_b_id` no longer exists in the book table
  (defense-in-depth against B3 missing edge cases).

### MAYDEPLOY-C: List-query perf cleanup
The big wins shipped (#1153 GetBookFilesForIDs memdb pushdown), but
the request path still has redundant work.

- [x] **C1** `server/audiobooks_handlers.go:buildAudiobookListResponse`
  calls `GetBookFilesForIDs(bookIDs)` directly AND
  `aggregateFileMetadata` also calls it. Pass the map from one to the
  other, eliminate the duplicate fetch. Saves ~2x for fingerprint
  compute path.
- [x] **C2** `PebbleStore.GetAllBookFiles` still does a full Pebble
  scan. Add a memdb fastpath like #1153 did for
  `GetBookFilesForIDs`. Acceptance: `aggregateFileMetadata` fallback
  path uses memdb when published.
- [x] **C3** Audit ALL `GetAll*` callers in request paths (handlers
  + services). Anything that fetches the full corpus to filter 20
  rows is the same bug class as #1149/#1153. Completed 2026-05-29 —
  see [`docs/perf-audit-2026-05-29-getall-callers.md`](docs/perf-audit-2026-05-29-getall-callers.md).
  8 HOT-BAD, 2 WARM-BAD findings filed as MAYDEPLOY-H1..H8 below.
  Easy `/health` win (`CountAuthors`/`CountSeries`) shipped in the
  audit PR.

### MAYDEPLOY-D: Heap baseline reduction
After the strip (#1152), memdb baseline is ~5GB (down from ~10GB).
Total process baseline is ~18GB, with chromem-go contributing ~6GB
via SQLite-to-chromem hydrate at startup.

- [x] **D1** `internal/dedup/engine.go:HydrateChromem` reads ALL
  `book` embeddings (1.8GB on disk) into memory at startup and
  mirrors to chromem. Add `DEDUP_CHROMEM_LAZY=true` env var that
  skips the eager hydrate; mirror lazy on first FindSimilar call.
- [x] **D2** chromem persistent dir `/var/lib/audiobook-organizer/chromem`
  is empty (1KB). Either fix chromem-go persistence so we don't
  re-hydrate from SQLite each restart, OR remove the
  `NewPersistentDB` call and use `NewDB()` (clearer intent).
- [x] **D3** Description / NotesJSON / BookSigV1 stripped from
  memdb in #1152 mean `field:description` filters silently return
  zero. Add a Pebble-backed fallback in
  `audiobooks/service.go:matchesFieldFilters` that fetches the
  full Book via GetBookByID ONLY when the predicate field is
  stripped — preserves correctness on rare descriptions filter.
- [x] **D4** Profile: trigger a fresh memdb warm, capture
  `inuse_space` heap profile, compare to pre-strip baseline. Confirm
  ~5GB drop matches expectations. File any remaining hot allocators
  as new D-tasks. — Structural audit (no live prof access) at
  `docs/perf-audit-2026-05-29-heap-breakdown.md`. Predicted memdb
  drop ~6.7 GB (8.5 GB → 1.7 GB). Observed RSS drop 67 → 39 GB ≈ 28 GB
  (GC headroom + arena release amplify the live-heap delta). Followups
  filed as MAYDEPLOY-I below.

### MAYDEPLOY-I: Heap baseline follow-ups (from D4 audit)
Structural audit (`docs/perf-audit-2026-05-29-heap-breakdown.md`)
identifies these next-biggest-win targets at the ~18 GB post-strip
baseline.

- [ ] **I1** [hold] Verify MAYDEPLOY-D1 (`DEDUP_CHROMEM_LAZY`) and D2
  (chromem persistence vs `NewDB()`) ship before any more memdb
  strips. Chromem is the largest remaining bucket (~6 GB live;
  3–6 GB savings projected).
- [x] **I2** Drop `works` table from memdb entirely. 211 K rows ×
  (~270 B/row + ~320 B index) ≈ 120 MB heap, and Works are queried
  in <0.1% of requests. Route the read paths through Pebble
  (`GetWorkByID`) on demand and delete the table from `memdbSchema()`
  + remove `stripBookForMemdb`-adjacent warmup. Est. savings: ~120 MB.
- [x] **I3** Add `stripBookFileForMemdb` (mirrors #1152). Clear the 7
  `AcoustIDSeg0..6` strings + 3 fingerprint-diagnostic `*string`/
  `*time.Time` fields. ~70 MB savings across 308 K book_files.
  AcoustID is read only by dedup, which already has a Pebble path.
- [x] **I4** Cap the 24h `list` / `facets` / `dedup` / `bookCache` /
  `audiobook_list` LRU caches by entry count (e.g. 1000), not just
  TTL. These hold full `gin.H` / `Book` payloads with descriptions
  and provenance maps; suspected ~0.5–1.5 GB of baseline. Touch
  points: `internal/server/server.go:335-337`,
  `internal/audiobooks/service.go:105-106`.
- [x] **I5** Truncate description text fed to bleve to first ~500
  chars (or skip indexing description entirely). bleve still indexes
  the full description from Pebble even though memdb has been stripped.
  Est. savings: 0.5–1 GB index residency.
- [ ] **I6** Once I1+I2+I3 ship (or chromem D1/D2 lands), re-run this
  audit with a real `inuse_space` heap profile from prod via
  `pprof_endpoint` — replace structural estimates with measured
  bytes. Target: baseline ~18 GB → ~10 GB.

## 🧭 Post-Deploy 2026-05-29 — Remaining Work

End-of-day state: MAYDEPLOY A→I shipped except items listed below. 45 PRs
merged today (#1147–#1191). RSS 67.8GB→39.6GB stable. "All Books" cold
~250ms, 500/page 3m51s→241ms. Fingerprint rescan hotfix #1191 in. Op-log
Copy + pause-on-hover in #1182.

### Highest-priority remainders

- [ ] **PD-1 / MAYDEPLOY-A revisit** [hold] — Subprocess isolation via parent-RPC
  bridge. Current `Isolate: true` cannot work because PebbleDB is
  single-writer and the child cannot reopen the store
  (`resource temporarily unavailable` on second open). Two viable paths:
  (a) child runs against a *read-only* Pebble snapshot and routes writes
  back through a unix-socket RPC to the parent's writer, or
  (b) drop subprocess isolation entirely and rely on in-process panic
  recovery + memory caps. Spec: `docs/specs/subprocess-isolation-rpc.md`.
- [x] **PD-2 / BUG-ITUNES-WRITEBACK-CORRUPTS-LIBRARY** — Fixed in PR #1319.
  Root cause: `buildMhohLE` set `headerLen = totalLen` instead of the fixed
  iTunes value of 24. iTunes uses `headerLen` to locate type-specific data
  within mhoh chunks; wrong value caused corrupt-library on next open. Also
  fixed `UpdateMetadataLE` to preserve original `headerLen` via
  `rewriteHohmLocationLE` when replacing existing mhoh chunks.
- [ ] **PD-3 / Post-deploy verification** — confirm in prod:
  (1) fingerprint-rescan from UI now actually runs (no
  "failed to unmarshal params"), (2) op-log Copy + Refresh buttons work,
  (3) RSS post-I2/I3/I4/I5 holds steady or drops further, (4) chromem
  switch from `NewPersistentDB` → `NewDB` doesn't regress dedup recall.
  See `docs/pd3-prod-verification.md` for the actionable plan and the
  verification table where results should be recorded.

### Deferred from MAYDEPLOY

- [x] **MAYDEPLOY-G5b** — back-fill poisoned `Book.Title` rows ✅ (2026-05-31)
  Op `maintenance.title-backfill` shipped; dry-run by default. Run with
  `{"dryRun": false}` on prod to apply. Old→new logged via op reporter.
- [ ] **MAYDEPLOY-G5c** — tighten `groupTracksByAlbum` to use
  `stripChapterPrefix(track.Name)` as the album key when Album tag is
  empty. Needs design pass — risks merging unrelated tracks that
  share a stripped prefix.
- [ ] **MAYDEPLOY-H5** [hold] — metadata-fetch-ids: when `len(bookIDs) < 100`,
  use per-book `GetAuthorByID` instead of materialising 8.8K authors.
  Low priority; defer until profiler shows actual cost.
- [ ] **MAYDEPLOY-H7** [hold] — Cache `isProtectedPath` / `GetAllImportPaths`
  with TTL or mutation invalidation. Low priority (~10 rows).
- [ ] **MAYDEPLOY-I1** [hold] — Verify D1 (`DEDUP_CHROMEM_LAZY`) and D2
  (`NewDB()`) shipped behaviour matches design. Needs live prod
  observation (`/system/status`, heap dump).
- [ ] **MAYDEPLOY-I6** [hold] — Re-run heap audit with live pprof from prod
  via `pprof_endpoint`. Replace structural estimates in
  `docs/perf-audit-2026-05-29-heap-breakdown.md` with measured bytes.
  Target: baseline ~18 GB → ~10 GB.

### Post-Task Hygiene (per CLAUDE.md)

- [ ] **PD-4** [hold] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with full MAYDEPLOY A–I sweep +
  Wave 4 PRs (#1182–#1191), prepending to current section, not
  overwriting.

---

### MAYDEPLOY-E: Pre-existing test failures
Surfaced during today's deploys but not caused by them; failing on
`main` too.

- [x] **E1** `TestHandler_RenameAuthor_Success` (`server/handlers_unit_test.go:982`)
  panics with nil pointer in `Cache.InvalidateAll`. Test creates a
  Server without initializing `authorsCache`. Fix test fixture to
  use `cache.New[any]("authors", 30*time.Second)`.
- [x] **E2** `TestPebbleStoreReset` (`database/coverage_test.go:841`)
  expects 0 authors after reset, gets 1. Likely a memdb-vs-pebble
  reset-order bug. Reproduce, fix, add regression test.
- [x] **E3** `TestEnrichAudiobooksWithNames_WithAuthorAndSeries`
  (`audiobooks/audiobook_service_unit_test.go:536`) fails because
  `aggregateFileMetadata` calls `GetBookFiles` per book and the
  mock has no expectation. Add `.EXPECT().GetBookFiles(...).Return(...).Maybe()`
  to the fixture.

### MAYDEPLOY-F: Trickle warmer tuning
The warmer's eager phase is fast post-#1153, but the trickle's heap
ceiling logic isn't quite right under sustained background activity
(chromem hydrate, dedup scans).

- [x] **F1** Eager warmer (in `library_list_warmer.go`) has no heap
  guard. If chromem hydrate is concurrent with eager, eager could
  pile on. Add same `readHeapAllocMB() > ceiling` check as trickle.
- [x] **F2** Trickle baseline is sampled once at start. If baseline
  drops over time (e.g., chromem hydrate completes and releases),
  ceiling stays artificially high. Re-sample baseline every 5 min
  (median of last 3 samples to dampen).

### MAYDEPLOY-G: Multi-file audiobook over-split detection + fix

Observed in prod (book `01KQGDQTJ44FCAPW5Z9D2KNQDE`,
`/Tarkin - Star Wars/Tarkin - Star Wars - 4/85.mp3`): the scanner
created **85 separate Book records for what is ONE 85-chapter
audiobook**. Each "book" has exactly one file. Titles like
`(76/85) Tarkin: Star Wars` where the `(76/85)` is fabricated and
doesn't even match the file's own chapter number (file is `4/85`
but Book says `76/85`). All 85 books sit in the same folder with
the same series + author, varying only by chapter number.

This is a different bug class than acoustic dedup — it's
**scanner mis-grouping** (one folder → many books instead of
one book × many BookFiles).

- [x] **G1** Scanner detection at import time:
  `internal/scan/` — when a folder contains N≥3 files matching a
  sequential numeric pattern (`*-N/M.ext`, `Chapter NN`,
  `NN of MM`, `Part NN`, etc.) AND the audio metadata's
  `album_artist`/`album` agree across files, treat as a single
  Book with N BookFiles. Add unit tests covering the
  `N/M`, `Chapter NN`, `Part NN`, `NN of MM`, and bare `NN.ext`
  patterns.
- [x] **G2** Backfill scan operation:
  `dedup.split-book-detector` (new opdef, in-process). Group
  existing Books by `(filepath.Dir(FilePath), author_id,
  series_id)`. Flag any group with ≥3 single-file books matching
  the sequential-naming heuristic above. Write results as new
  `book_split_candidate` rows in embedding store (or new table)
  for review.
- [x] **G3** API + UI for reviewing split candidates:
  `GET /api/v1/dedup/split-candidates` returns flagged groups
  (parent folder + book list + suggested merged title).
  `POST /api/v1/dedup/split-candidates/:id/merge` collapses the N
  books into one (keep oldest book ID, move all files to it,
  delete the rest). UI: new tab in the Dedup page alongside
  acoustic/embedding candidates.
- [x] **G4** One-shot CLI:
  `tools/cmd/merge-split-books/` (mirrors
  `tools/cmd/reconcile-paths/`). Reads split-candidate rows,
  prints dry-run plan, optionally executes. Operator runs once
  against the existing ~thousands of over-split books in the
  library.
- [x] **G5a** Strip leading `(N/M)` / `Chapter N` prefix from
  iTunes per-chapter track Names when fall-back populates
  `Book.Title`. Root-cause analysis:
  `docs/perf-audit-2026-05-29-g5-title-mismatch.md`.
  Source of the `(76/85)` prefix: `buildBookFromAlbumGroup`
  fell back to `firstTrack.Name` when iTunes Album tag was
  empty, writing the per-chapter Name into `Book.Title`. The
  file-vs-title mismatch (file=4, title=76) is a second-order
  artifact from a later organizer/dedup reassignment, not a
  second bug. Fix: `stripChapterPrefix` helper in
  `internal/itunes/service/strip_chapter_prefix.go`, applied
  only in the empty-Album fall-back branch.
- [x] **G5b** Back-fill existing poisoned `Book.Title` rows ✅ (2026-05-31)
  `maintenance.title-backfill` op shipped. Dry-run default.
- [ ] **G5c** Tighten `groupTracksByAlbum` to use
  `stripChapterPrefix(track.Name)` as the album key when the
  Album tag is empty. Currently every chapter falls back to a
  unique key (the raw Name) and becomes its own book record.
  Deferred — risks merging unrelated tracks that happen to
  share a stripped prefix; needs a separate design pass.
- [x] **G6** Once G1 lands, the legacy `book_files` rows for the
  merged-away books should be cleaned up by G3/G4's merge path —
  but verify orphan rows aren't left in the `book_files` table
  (deleted bookID still has rows). Add a maintenance task
  `maintenance.orphan-book-files-cleanup` that lists `book_file`
  rows whose `book_id` no longer exists, surfaces a count, and
  optionally deletes them.

### MAYDEPLOY-H: GetAll\* pushdown wins from C3 audit

C3 audit findings — see [`docs/perf-audit-2026-05-29-getall-callers.md`](docs/perf-audit-2026-05-29-getall-callers.md).
HOT-BAD callers that fetch the entire corpus to filter a small subset in
synchronous handlers. Same bug class as PR #1149/#1153. The easy 5-line
`/health` win (CountAuthors/CountSeries instead of GetAllAuthors/GetAllSeries)
landed in this audit PR; the rest need a new store method or memdb index.

- [x] **H1** `internal/server/itunes_handlers.go:534,607` — `handleListITunesBooks`
  + writeback-preview load all 50K books to filter by
  `ITunesPersistentID != ""`. Add a memdb secondary index on
  `book.itunes_persistent_id` and a new `ListBooksByITunesPID(limit, offset)`
  store method. Pebble keeps current scan as cold-start fallback.
  Acceptance: `GET /api/v1/itunes/books?limit=20` returns in <100ms hot,
  no full-corpus materialization.

- [x] **H2** `internal/server/deluge_discovery.go:134` — Deluge discovery
  handler loads 308K BookFiles to filter by `DelugeHash != ""`. Switch to
  the existing `store.GetBookFilesNeedingDelugeImport()` wrapper, then
  add a memdb fastpath inside that method (index on non-empty
  `deluge_hash` + null `imported_from_deluge_at`). Mirror the #1153/#1166
  fastpath pattern. Also fixes `internal/plugins/deluge/centralization.go:66`.
  Acceptance: `POST /api/v1/deluge/discover` returns in <100ms hot.

- [x] **H3** `internal/server/entities_handlers.go:118,154` — `listWork` /
  `getWorkStats` use GetAllWorks + per-work `GetBooksByWorkID` (N+1). Add
  `GetWorkBookCounts() map[string]int` (mirrors `GetAllAuthorBookCounts`).
  `listWork` should also paginate. Acceptance: `GET /api/v1/works`
  returns in <200ms with 50K works; `GET /api/v1/works/stats` <50ms.

- [x] **H4** `internal/server/metadata_batch_candidates.go:846` — unfetched
  count loads all Book structs to extract IDs. Add `store.ListBookIDs()
  ([]string, error)` that returns only string IDs (Pebble: iter without
  Value(); memdb: project from books table without copy). Saves ~50×
  memory. Acceptance: `GET /api/v1/metadata/candidates?include_unfetched=true`
  uses <10MB peak vs ~50MB today.

- [ ] **H5** [hold] `internal/server/metadata_handlers.go:1283` — metadata-fetch-ids
  op always materializes 8.8K authors even for 20-book requests. When
  `len(bookIDs) < 100`, use per-book `GetAuthorByID`. Low priority.

- [x] **H6** `internal/scanner/scanner.go:1533,1551` — scanner calls
  `GetAllWorks()` per-book during scan (N² behavior). Build a
  `map[normalizedTitle+authorID]workID` once at scan start, invalidate
  on new-work creation. Cuts scan time on 50K-work corpus by ~10x.

- [ ] **H7** [hold] `internal/server/server_middleware.go:90` and
  `internal/audiobooks/helpers.go:248` — `isProtectedPath` calls
  `GetAllImportPaths()` per-file. Cache with TTL or invalidate on
  import-path mutation. Low priority (~10 rows total).

- [x] **H8** `internal/database/pebble_store.go:8515` —
  `GetBookFilesNeedingDelugeImport` is still a `GetAllBookFiles` wrapper.
  Folded into H2's memdb index work.

### How to fan out
Each task is independent within its parent letter group; A1→A2→A3
must sequence, but A and B are parallelizable. Spawn:
- One **Haiku** agent per task, scoped to the single file noted.
- Each agent owns: branch creation, the fix, build verify, `gh pr create`,
  admin-merge gate (do NOT merge — let a reviewer signoff).
- Coordinator (or the user) merges in MAYDEPLOY letter order so
  Subprocess (A) lands before Dedup UX (B) (B may reuse the
  Isolate path).

## 🐛 Open Bugs — May 17, 2026

- [x] **BUG-ITUNES-WRITEBACK-CORRUPTS-LIBRARY** — Fixed in PR #1319 (2026-06-05). See PD-2.

  **Bisect hint (user, 2026-05-28):** iTunes writeback was working at some point in the past. Find when active feature work on `internal/itunes/` stopped — the breaking change is most likely in the refactor/security/perf commits that came AFTER the last functional feature commit. Candidates to bisect first (newest → oldest):
  - `ee180f84 perf(itunes): implement streaming XML parser for backfill operation` — most likely. Streaming XML changes how we read/emit plist structures; subtle byte-output differences would corrupt .itl.
  - `8c7269af fix(itl): add size cap before uint32 buffer allocations (SEC-AUDIT-8 #468)` — buffer caps on writes could silently truncate atom data.
  - `03380992 fix(security): validate ITunesLibraryWritePath before passing to ITL read funcs (SEC-AUDIT-4b)` and `7b07f17e fix(security): break taint chain in iTunes/audiobook path handlers (SEC-AUDIT-4)` — path normalization side effects (e.g., resolving symlinks could change what we open/write).
  - Last known-good baseline: `f2856e45 feat(itunes): full ITL rebuild-from-DB + partial export (Tasks 033/035)`.

  Procedure: `git checkout f2856e45 -- internal/itunes/` into a worktree, build, attempt writeback against a SAFE copy of an .itl, confirm iTunes accepts it. Then `git bisect` from there to `main`.

- [x] **BUG-STORAGE-PCT-WRONG** (2026-05-20) ✅ Fixed 2026-05-25.

- [x] **BUG-DEDUP-SAMEDIR** Embedding dedup flags chapter files from the same directory as 100% duplicates. ✅ Fixed PR #1001. Multi-file audiobooks split into segments (e.g. `011.mp3`, `062.mp3`) share identical text embeddings and score 100% similar. Fix: add `filepath.Dir(A.FilePath) == filepath.Dir(B.FilePath)` guard in `internal/dedup/engine.go` emission loop (~line 840) and in `PurgeStaleCandidates` (~line 1446). The `bookMeta` struct needs a `filePath string` field.

- [x] **BUG-RECONCILE-OPID** Reconcile tab hits `GET /api/v1/operations/undefined/status` ✅ Fixed PR #1000. Deploy pending. because the POST response wraps the op in `{data: {op_id: "..."}}` but the frontend was reading the raw body as an `Operation`. **Fix shipped in PR #1000** (`startReconcileScan` now extracts `.data` and normalizes `op_id → id`). Needs production deploy.

- [x] **BUG-SERIES-COUNT** Series dedup tab shows "Total series: 0" even when a scan just found 2442 duplicate groups. ✅ Fixed PRs #1008 (band-aid: UpdateOperationStatus on scan complete) + #1009 (proper fix: getOperationStatus falls through to v2 registry; scan handlers no longer create legacy ops).

- [x] **BUG-ACTIVITY-MISSING-OLD-LOGS** ✅ Fixed in PR #1020. Activity log now backfills old `system_activity_log` entries (pre-May 12) on server startup. Migration is idempotent and includes test coverage (`TestMigrateSystemActivityLogs`). Field mapping: `created_at → timestamp`, `message → summary`, `tier="system"`, `type="system_log"`, `tags=["legacy", "system_activity_log"]`.

- [x] **INFRA-OPENTELEMETRY** ✅ Shipped PR #1022. Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation for metrics, spans, and traces. Implemented:
  - `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` + SDK + OTLP gRPC exporter
  - HTTP layer instrumentation via `otelgin` middleware
  - DB instrumentation: `InstrumentedActivityStorer` wrapper
  - Operation execution instrumentation with root spans
  - AI/external call instrumentation helper (`WithOpenAISpan`)
  - Dedup engine spans for `FullScan`, `CheckBook`, `PurgeStaleCandidates`
  - Prometheus metrics endpoint at `/metrics`
  - Config: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env var; disabled by default

- [x] **BUG-OP-SPARSE-LOGS** (PR #1014) Operations emit almost no log messages to the activity log — only a final result line. Every operation should emit at minimum: (1) start message with scope/count, (2) progress phase-change messages (e.g. "scanning", "comparing", "writing"), (3) per-item or per-batch progress every ~10%, (4) completion summary with counts (processed/skipped/errored), (5) any error/warn lines. Target 4–8 log lines per operation for short ops, more for long ones. Fix: audit every `op.Run(ctx)` handler in `internal/server/` and ensure `EmitInfo`/`LogBatch` calls are present at each phase. Use existing `activity.EmitInfo(w, opID, type, source, msg)` API.

- [x] **FEAT-ACTIVITY-RICH-TAGS** ✅ Implemented in PR #1021. Activity log entries now auto-enrich with structured tags at write time:
  - `op:<op_id>` — ties every log line to its operation
  - `book:<book_id>` — ties to specific book
  - `action:<verb>` — metadata-apply, tag-write, import, reconcile, fingerprint, dedup, organizer, purge, cover-update, maintenance, write-back, scan
  - `outcome:ok|warn|error|skip` — derived from Level field
  - `source:<subsystem>` — itunes, acoustid, openai, openlibrary, scanner, scheduler, etc.
  - `scope:book` — entity type affected (simple heuristic)
  - Backend: `EnrichTags()` in `internal/activity/api.go`, called from `Service.Record()` before store write. No call-site changes needed.
  - Frontend: multi-select tag chip filter UI in ActivityLog.tsx with Outcome and Action preset filters. Tags passed to API with AND semantics.
  - Tests: comprehensive TestEnrichTags with 7 subtests + idempotency + nil handling. All passing.
  - Note: Count refresh after scan is a separate timing issue (auto-refresh interval changes from 5s to 30s when op completes); can address separately if needed.

- [x] **BUG-ACOUSTID-SCAN-OPID** "AcoustID scan queued (op: unknown)" toast ✅ Fixed PR #1000. Deploy pending. because `triggerDedupAcoustID` was reading `raw.id` but backend returns `op_id`. **Fix shipped in PR #1000**. Needs production deploy.

---

## AI Model Configuration

- [x] **AI-MODEL-1** Per-feature LLM model knob — adds `DedupReviewModel`, `MetadataReviewModel`, `FilenameParseModel`, `CoverArtModel` to `config.Config` (defaults `gpt-5-mini`). Replaces hardcoded literals in `openai_parser.go`, `openai_batch.go`, `metadata_llm_review.go`, and `dedup/engine.go` with config getters. PR feat/per-feature-llm-model.

---

## ✅ Completed — May 24, 2026

- [x] **CHAI-SQL-PHASE1-4** Chai SQL migration Phases 1–4 complete. Chai DB opens alongside PebbleDB at startup. Write-through sync (`UpsertBookToChaiDB`) populates `book_files`. `GetBooksBySeriesID_Chai` (Task 3.2) and `GetBooksByAuthorID_Chai` (Task 3.3) implemented with pagination. Denormalized `book:series`/`book:author` prefix indexes removed (Task 3.4) — superseded by Chai SQL variants. `pref_key` column renamed from reserved word `key`. `scanBookFromSQL` NULL handling fixed for non-pointer string fields.
- [x] **PERF-N1-ALL** All 8 N+1 query patterns eliminated: full JSON stored in indices instead of IDs; batch `GetBookFilesForIDs` added; per-object point lookups removed. Critical memory-load paths fixed: `SearchBooks` (was 1M load), `GetDistinctGenres/Languages` (50K load), quarantine/iTunes status queries (100K loads). Quick-query pagination fixed (was applying filters post-page).
- [x] **PERF-CACHE-WARMUP-FIX** Emergency: disabled all cache warm-up goroutines (`warmAuthorsCache`, `warmSeriesCache`, `warmFacetsCache`) after 81GB OOM. Root cause TBD — warm-up objects likely retain full API response objects. `[[project_cache_warmup_memory_fix]]`
- [x] **PERF-AUTHORS-SERIES-CACHE** Authors/series endpoint caching with 24h TTL + mutation invalidation. Response time <100ms from cache (was 3-6 min from N+1).
- [x] **LOG-RECONCILE-PATHS** Convert `tools/cmd/reconcile-paths/main.go` from `log.Printf`/`log.Fatal` to `fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ...)`. Last `log` import in any non-server tool file removed. `go vet ./...` clean.
- [x] **SLOG-W12** Operation context logging end-to-end (PR #1047). New `internal/logging.OpContext` propagated via `context.Context`; `logging.Info/Warn/Error/Debug(ctx, ...)` auto-tag every record with `opID`/`opType`/`opStatus`/`entities`. Wired into 12 ops (metadata-fetch ×2, dedup ×8, library scan/organize/transcode). New endpoint `GET /api/v1/operations/:id/activity`. End-to-end test `TestEndToEndLoggingFlow` captures real slog JSON output and asserts attr propagation. Cleanup: restored 3 maintenance jobs' `reporter.Log` calls W11 dropped; fixed ~30 leftover slog KV-pair vet errors across 8+ files; `go vet ./...` now clean across the whole module.
- [x] **SLOG-W12-UI** Per-operation activity panel (PR #1049). React component consumes `/api/v1/operations/:id/activity`, mounted in `OperationsIndicator` notifications bell. Reusable anywhere.
- [x] **SLOG-W11** Repair W10's incomplete printf → kv conversion: 674 format-string fixes + 134 malformed-message cleanups (PRs #1036, #1037).
- [x] **SLOG-W10** Wave 10 — migrated 265 log.Printf calls across 38 files to slog (PR #1036).

### Library UI follow-ups

- [ ] **User-saved quick filters.** Let users save the current filter set as a named preset and surface it in the header kebab menu alongside the six built-in counts. Persist per-user (settings table), include in `/library/quick-queries` payload, edit/delete from a "Manage" submenu.

### Remaining slog / logging work

- [ ] **SLOG-W13** [hold] Wire `logging.Info(ctx, ...)` into long-tail async ops that currently use raw `slog.Info`: `runBulkWriteBack`, ISBN enrichment goroutine, iTunes sync ops, batch poller, scanner deep paths. ~1363 raw `slog.Info/Warn/Error/Debug` calls across 193 files remain. Priority: any code inside an op-context flow (where `logging.WithOp` has been called upstream). Code outside ops (startup, background goroutines) can stay as raw slog.
- [ ] **SLOG-PROD-VERIFY** Smoke-test metadata-fetch on prod to verify the full chain (opID in logs, `/api/v1/operations/:id/activity` returns rows).
- [ ] **CACHE-WARMUP-ROOT-CAUSE** Investigate root cause of cache warm-up OOM. Likely issue: `List*WithCounts()` allocates unboundedly during scan, or the `Server` struct cache fields retain full API response objects. Once fixed, re-enable startup preload.

## ✅ Completed — May 11, 2026

- [x] **SERVER-THIN-1** Extract `DashboardService` → `internal/sysinfo` (PR #803)
- [x] **SERVER-THIN-2** Extract `UpdateService` (config) → `internal/config` (PR #804)
- [x] **SERVER-THIN-3** Extract `MetadataStateService` → `internal/metafetch` (PR #805)
- [x] **SERVER-THIN-4** Extract `EvaluateSmartPlaylist` → `internal/playlist` (PR #807)
- [x] **SERVER-THIN-5** Fix stale Queue mock + GlobalQueue references blocking CI
- [x] **SERVER-THIN-6** Wave 2 parallel-sweep (PRs #807–#816): sweep, work, undo, batch, path-format, openlibrary, reconcile, similar-books, user-tags, maintenance
- [x] **SERVER-THIN-7** Wave 3 parallel-sweep (PRs #817–#829): scheduler, metabatch, deluge, dedup, organizer/checkpoint, backfills, covers, archive-sweep, versions, itl-rebuild, remux, import-collision, audio-sample. `internal/server` is now a pure HTTP adapter layer.

---

## 🔜 Next — Post-server-thinning

- [x] **SERVER-PLUGIN-REG** Service registry analogous to `opRegistry`. Spec + plan
  in `docs/architecture/server-plugin-registry-{design,plan}.md`. All 7 waves shipped:
  - [x] **W0** Registry foundation — `internal/serviceregistry` package + 12 tests (PR #832)
  - [x] **W1** Leaf services (PRs #835–#843)
  - [x] **W1.INT** NewServer registry-flow integration (PR #844)
  - [x] **W2** Cross-wired services — metafetch / activity / merge / quarantine / organize (PRs #864–#868)
  - [x] **W2.INT** Wire W2 services into NewServer (PR #869)
  - [x] **W3** Start/Stop services — writebackbatcher / updatescheduler / activitywriter / searchindex / opregistry / batchpoller / librarywatcher (PRs #870–#877 incl. fix-up)
  - [x] **W4** Embedding/AI cluster — embedclient / llmparser / embeddingstore / chromemstore / aijobsstore / dedup / metadatascorer / metadatallmscorer (PR #878)
  - [x] **W5** UOS plugin migrations (PR #879) — 3 real registrations (dedup, acoustid, deluge), 2 documented stubs (maintenance, itunes) blocked on server-bound closures
  - [x] **W6** Scheduler residual extraction — closes SERVER-THIN-RESIDUAL (PR #880)
  - [x] **W7** Final wrap-up (this PR) — CHANGELOG/TODO consolidated; follow-ups split out below

### 🧹 Follow-ups split from SERVER-PLUGIN-REG W7

The "trim NewServer to ≤50 lines" and "audit GetGlobalStore" deliverables from
the original W7 plan turned out to be substantially larger than a single
final-cleanup PR. Splitting them out as their own tickets to be worked
incrementally:

- [x] **SERVER-LIFECYCLE-FLIP** Wire `Container.Start(ctx)` / `Container.Stop(ctx)`
  into Server.Start / Server.Shutdown. **Completed** across PRs #882–#951:
  all sub-services (updatescheduler, searchindex, activitywriter, aiScanStore,
  pipelineManager, dedupEngine) are container-driven. Verified in code.

- [x] **SERVER-GLOBAL-STORE-AUDIT** Remove production `database.GetGlobalStore()`
  callers. **Completed**: production code has 3 remaining calls, all of which
  are intentional test-path fallbacks in `server.go:Store()`, `server.go:NewServer`,
  and `scanner.go:getStore()`. No hot-path callers remain.

- [~] **PLUGIN-DECOUPLE-SERVER-CLOSURES** Decouple `itunesservice.Service` from
  server-bound closures (`OnBookCreated`, `OrganizerFactory`). Deferred to
  post-matcher work.

  **Maintenance plugin — done (PR #935).** The empty stub registration was
  deleted; the plugin registers inline from `internal/server/server.go:~402`
  and that is the documented canonical pattern until `ServerDeps` itself is
  broken up. See `internal/plugins/maintenance/register.go` for the rationale.

  **itunesservice — ✅ done (Task 032, verified 2026-05-17).** `OnBookCreated` closure replaced by `plugin.EventPublisher` (publishes `EventBookImported`); dedup engine subscribes via EventBus in `Engine.PostInit` (`internal/dedup/lifecycle.go`). `OrganizerFactory` remains as the sole closure by design — it's a lazy factory that injects the organizer without importing internal/organizer into itunesservice. No *Server captures remain. Wiring: `internal/server/registry_wire.go:~211–245`.

- [x] **SERVER-THIN-RESIDUAL** `scheduler_extra_ops.go` residual extracted to
  `internal/scheduler/extra_ops.go` as `*ExtraOpsRegistrar` (W6). All 13 ops moved;
  server shim delegates via `s.extraOpsRegistrar`.

- [x] **SERVER-THIN-8** Pre-existing iTunes/organize/scan timeout failures fixed
  (PRs #919, #920 — 2026-05-13). Root causes: (a) test setup didn't start the
  opRegistry worker pool so enqueued ops never ran; (b) plugin SDK's
  `itunes.import` stub (Isolate=true, Run=no-op) won the registration race and
  routed runs through a no-op subprocess; (c) handler returned legacy v1 op
  id while v2 was the canonical record. Tests now Start the registry, the
  stub is removed from the plugin Register list, and the v2→v1 status
  bridge fires from `itunes_ops` and `folder_autoscan_op`.

## 🧹 Tech Debt Sweep — Deprecated Code & Warnings

- [x] **TECHDEBT-1** Audit and remove deprecated code across the entire codebase
  - Backend: scan for `// Deprecated:` markers, dead code paths flagged in past evaluations, unused exported symbols, packages with replacement candidates already in use.
  - Frontend: ~~resolve **React Router v6 future-flag warnings**~~ (done — PR #949; `v7_startTransition` + `v7_relativeSplatPath` added to all BrowserRouter/MemoryRouter usages in main.tsx and all test files). Then upgrade-prep for v7 properly.
  - Frontend: audit `package.json` for deprecated transitive deps (`npm outdated`, `npm audit`), remove dead Material-UI v4-style imports if any remain, ~~kill `console.log` left in src~~ (verified clean — no console.log in production source files).
  - Go: `staticcheck`/`go vet` clean run; remove unused mocks; ~~replace `ioutil.*` with `io`/`os`~~ (verified clean — no `io/ioutil` imports remain); collapse redundant context plumbing flagged in `docs/codebase-evaluation.md`.
  - SQL: drop schema columns/tables marked deprecated in migration history once readers/writers are gone.
  - Tests: replace `t.Skip` markers, remove `//nolint` that no longer apply, dedupe fixture builders.
  - Output: one PR per cluster (router warnings, backend deprecated APIs, frontend deps, dead code) so each can review/revert independently.

## 🔒 Security Alert Sweep — Audit 2026-05-03

**Complete inventory and remediation plan for all GitHub security alerts.**

**Audit Documents:**
- **Spec:** [`docs/security/audit-2026-05-03/spec.md`](docs/security/audit-2026-05-03/spec.md) — Alert inventory, severity breakdown, remediation recommendations

### Phase -1: CodeQL Custom Sanitizer Pack (Noise Reduction)

- [x] **SEC-AUDIT--1** Deploy CodeQL Models-as-Data pack for existing sanitizers
  - **Priority:** P0 (Unblocks Phase 1-6 by reducing false positives)
  - **Effort:** 2 hours
  - **Alerts:** Expected to reduce path injection from 217 → ~120-140 (~77 FP reduction)
  - **Files:** `.github/codeql/` (new pack), `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`, `docs/security/audit-2026-05-03/spec.md`
  - **Action:** Create MaD pack declaring `internal/util.SafeJoin` and `internal/util.WithinRoot` as path-injection sanitizers
  - **Dependencies:** None
  - **Status:** ✅ **IN PROGRESS** (PR pending)
  - **Details:** 
    - Pack declares `SafeJoin` return value as barrier for path-injection
    - Pack declares `WithinRoot` as barrier guard (conditional sanitizer)
    - Based on sast-sca-auditor spot-check: 35-45% of alerts are FPs from CodeQL not recognizing existing sanitizers
  - **Spec:** [`spec.md#remediation-strategy-phase-0`](docs/security/audit-2026-05-03/spec.md#remediation-strategy)

### Phase 0: Unblock Govulncheck

  - **Priority:** P0
  - **Effort:** 3 hours
  - **Files:** `internal/server/covers.go`, `internal/server/cover_history.go`
  - **Dependencies:** Phase 2
  - **Plan:** [`implementation-plan.md#phase-3`](docs/security/audit-2026-05-03/implementation-plan.md#phase-3-path-injection--server-handlers-covers)

- [x] **SEC-AUDIT-4** Fix path injection in iTunes/transfer/audiobook handlers (20+ alerts: #627-#603, #619-#588) — PR #1016
  - **Priority:** P0
  - **Effort:** 6 hours
  - **Files:** `internal/server/itunes_handlers.go`, `internal/itunes/service/transfer.go`, `internal/server/audiobooks_handlers.go`, `internal/audiobooks/service.go`, `internal/server/server.go`

- [x] **SEC-AUDIT-5** Fix path injection in scanner/reconcile/OpenLibrary (15+ alerts: #618-#608)
  - **Priority:** P0
  - **Effort:** 5 hours
  - **Files:** `internal/scanner/service.go`, `internal/reconcile/reconcile.go`, `internal/server/openlibrary_service.go`, `internal/importer/service.go`
  - **Dependencies:** Phase 2
  - **Plan:** [`implementation-plan.md#phase-5`](docs/security/audit-2026-05-03/implementation-plan.md#phase-5-path-injection--scannerreconcileopenlibrary)

### Phase 7: Non-Path-Injection Errors (14 alerts)

- [x] **SEC-AUDIT-7a** Fix clear-text logging — Converted all `log.Printf` in `maintenance_fixups.go` to structured `slog.Info`/`slog.Warn` with named key-value attrs (PR #957). `cmd/root.go` uses `fmt.Printf` for CLI output, not a logging sink — no change needed (false positive).

- [x] **SEC-AUDIT-7b** Fix SSRF in `DownloadCoverArt` — Added `safeCoverDialContext` with RFC1918/loopback/link-local IP blocking and scheme validation (`http`/`https` only) to `metadata/cover.go` (PR #958). `server/covers.go` already had `IsAllowedCoverSource` domain allowlist. `deluge/client.go` + `plugins/webhook/plugin.go` connect to admin-configured endpoints (not SSRF-relevant).

- [x] **SEC-AUDIT-7c** Fix uncontrolled allocation — `MaxScanBufferBytes` cap added to `scanner.go` in PR #768; buffer capped at `hashChunkSize` (1 MiB).

- [x] **SEC-AUDIT-7d** Fix zipslip in backup extraction — `isPathWithinTarget` already implemented in `backup/backup.go` with `filepath.Rel` escape check; called before every tar entry extraction.

- [x] **SEC-AUDIT-7e** Fix weak sensitive data hashing — `settings.go` already uses `argon2.IDKey` (Argon2id, 64 MiB, 1 iter, 4 threads) via `DeriveKeyFromPassword`. SHA-256 replaced in a prior PR.

### Phase 8: Warnings (4 alerts)

- [x] **SEC-AUDIT-8** Fix warning-level alerts (4 alerts: #379, #468, #160, #50) — PR #970
  - **Priority:** P2-P3
  - **Effort:** 3.5 hours
  - **Alerts:** Disabled cert check (#379), allocation overflow (#468), JS cert bypass (#160), incomplete sanitization (#50)
  - **Files:** `internal/mtls/provisioning.go`, `internal/itunes/itl.go`, `scripts/record_demo.js`, `web/src/pages/Settings.tsx`
  - **Plan:** [`implementation-plan.md#phase-8`](docs/security/audit-2026-05-03/implementation-plan.md#phase-8-warnings-4-alerts)

### Phase 9: Dependabot

- [x] **SEC-AUDIT-9** Bump follow-redirects to 1.16.0+ (1 alert: #27, GHSA-r4q5-vmmm-2653)
  - **Priority:** P2
  - **Effort:** 0.5 hours
  - **Files:** `web/package-lock.json`
  - **Action:** `npm update follow-redirects && npm audit fix`
  - **Plan:** [`implementation-plan.md#phase-9`](docs/security/audit-2026-05-03/implementation-plan.md#phase-9-dependabot-1-alert)

### Phase 10: Documentation

- [x] **SEC-AUDIT-10** Document path validation policy & add dismissal comments
  - **Priority:** P3
  - **Effort:** 1.5 hours
  - **Action:** Create `docs/security/path-validation-policy.md`, add comments to 13 dismissed alerts (#560-#547)
  - **Plan:** [`implementation-plan.md#phase-10`](docs/security/audit-2026-05-03/implementation-plan.md#phase-10-documentation--dismissed-alerts)

### Phase 11: Verification

- [ ] **SEC-AUDIT-11** Final verification — Dismiss post-audit findings
  - **Current Status:** 492 open alerts (mostly post-audit findings, not in scope of Phases 1-10)
  - **Breakdown:**
    - `go/path-injection` 220 (217 original + 3-9 new from May 18 code; new ones from OTEL/legacy-migration likely safe)
    - `go/log-injection` 255 (new category post-audit; CodeQL conservatively flags %s format usage; likely 90%+ false positives)
    - Other 17 (request-forgery 4, allocation 2, workflow perms 2, others 9)
  - **Action:** Re-run codescanning alerts query and document findings. Original Phases 1-10 successfully remediated 217 path-injection and 6 clear-text logging alerts. Post-audit findings (log-injection, +9 path-injection) represent new CodeQL pattern maturity or code changes, not regressions. Recommend dismissing as accepted-risk with documented rationale per alert.
  - **Success Criteria:** All original 236 alerts (Phase 0-10 scope) have been addressed. New post-audit findings to be scoped separately (Phase 12).
  - **Completion:** Mark Phase 11 complete once bulk-dismissal rationales are added to CodeQL dashboard

### Phase 12: Log Injection (255 alerts, NEW category post-audit)

- [ ] **SEC-AUDIT-12** [hold] Investigate and remediate log-injection alerts
  - **Priority:** P1 (review required; likely low-risk false positives)
  - **Alerts:** 255 open (go/log-injection, error severity)
  - **Affected areas:** dedup, server handlers, system services (all files logging bookID, userInput, or paths)
  - **Root cause analysis:** CodeQL flags user-controlled data (bookID, file paths, book IDs) flowing into `log.Printf(...%s...)` calls. With %s format specifier, this is safe — input is interpolated as literal string, not executed as format string.
  - **Distinction from clear-text logging:** This is not about sensitive data visibility; it's about format-string injection risk in logging APIs.
  - **Assessment:** Likely 90%+ false positives with standard `log.Printf`/`fmt.Errorf` using %s. Remediation (if needed) involves wrapping user data with safe logging helpers or structured slog attributes.
  - **Decision point:** Recommended approach is to dismiss with rationale: "Log injection with %s format specifier is safe; user input is interpolated as literal string, not executed." Alternatively, create slog structured logging migration for higher confidence.
  - **Effort if fixing:** 8-12 hours to audit all 255 occurrences and apply structured logging.

**Estimated Total Effort (Phases 1-11 COMPLETE + Phase 12 optional):** 44 hours base + 8-12 hours optional Phase 12 remediation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All 236 open alerts addressed (fixed or consciously dismissed with rationale)
- ✅ Govulncheck runs successfully on jsonv2 builds
- ✅ All PRs merged, `make ci` passes on main
- ✅ Post-remediation audit confirms 0 open alerts (or only accepted-risk)

## ⭐ User Ratings UI — DB + schema done, API + UI pending

PR #516 added full Audible rating dimensions (5 dims + count + reviews) and Google Books
(rating + count) to DB and metadata pipeline. PR #517 reserved `user_rating_overall`,
`user_rating_story`, `user_rating_performance`, `user_rating_notes` on `books` table.
PR #520 wires Audible `runtime_length_min` into candidate scoring. Still needed:

- [x] Audible ratings ingested (overall/story/performance/concept/delivery + count + reviews) — PR #516
- [x] Google Books ratings ingested (rating + count) — PR #516
- [x] User rating columns reserved on `books` table — PR #517
- [x] Duration scoring for candidates from Audible runtime — PR #520
- [x] **RATE-1** `PATCH /api/v1/audiobooks/:id/rating` accepts `{overall, story, performance, notes}` — PR #542
- [x] **RATE-2** Book detail UI: star rating widget (overall / story / performance + notes) — PR #552
- [x] **RATE-3** Audible/Google ratings shown on MetadataReviewDialog candidate cards — PR #553
- [x] **RATE-4** Library search/filter with numeric operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=) for user_rating_* — PR #554
- [x] **RATE-5** Bulk rating view / quick-rate from list

## ⏱️ Audible Runtime vs Book Duration Mismatch Detection

Audible returns `runtime_length_min` for every product. We now store `Duration`
on the `books` table (set during metadata apply). These two numbers should be
within ~10 minutes of each other — large gaps (> 10 min) suggest the wrong
Audible product was matched or the file is an abridged version.

- [x] WARN log + `duration_mismatch` flag on candidate result when delta > 600s — PR #549
- [x] `GET /api/v1/maintenance/scan-duration-mismatch` bulk scan endpoint — PR #549
- [x] **DUR-1** Surface in `MetadataReviewDialog`: show a yellow warning chip on the candidate row when `audible_runtime_min` and book `duration` differ by > 10 min, e.g. "⚠ runtime differs by 45 min" — chip implemented at `MetadataReviewDialog.tsx:604`
- [x] Book detail panel: show Audible runtime alongside local duration so mismatches are obvious — PR #561
- [x] Threshold configurable via query param `?max_delta_min=10` — PR #549

## 🔒 Deluge Protected Paths — Reflink Import Workflow

**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-deluge-protected-paths-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-deluge-protected-paths-design.md)

Core rule: never edit files outside `RootDir`. Deluge files are reflinked into the library before any tag write, then `core.move_storage` keeps Deluge seeding from the new location.

Implementation steps (in order):

- [x] **DELUGE-1** `deluge_hash`, `deluge_original_path`, `imported_from_deluge_at` columns on `book_files` — PR #540
- [x] **DELUGE-2** `protectedPathCache` with TTL refresh + IsProtected() — PR #556
- [x] **DELUGE-3** `importToLibrary`: reflink `src → library_path`, update DB, call `core.move_storage` if enabled (best-effort). Implemented in fleet branch `fleet/014-deluge-3-import-to-library` (PR #976). Bot-task: [`docs/superpowers/bot-tasks/2026-04-29-deluge-3-import-to-library.md`](docs/superpowers/bot-tasks/2026-04-29-deluge-3-import-to-library.md)
- [ ] **`WriteTagsSafe`**: pre-flight guard wrapping all tag-write call sites; falls back to `os.Copy` on non-reflink FS
- [ ] **Migrate all call sites** [hold] to `WriteTagsSafe` (bulk write-back, single-file write, cover embed)
- [x] **Discovery → Import UI**: "Import" button on discovered torrent calls the import flow — PR #562
- [x] **UI**: "Imported from Deluge" badge on book detail; original path shown in Files tab audit row — PR #561
- [x] **Config**: add `protected_paths []string` field; expose in Settings UI — PR #562

## 🔗 iTunes Relink — Unresolved Cases

PR #507 shipped the iTunes relink endpoint (3-tier path resolver: same-dir M4B → flat iTunes
search → disambiguation). It resolved **94.7%** of broken organizer-root books. Three groups
of cases remain:

**13 manually-identified unresolved books** — documented in [`docs/reports/unresolved-relinks-2026-04-28.md`](docs/reports/unresolved-relinks-2026-04-28.md). Root causes: co-author directory mismatch (organizer uses plain author, iTunes uses `Author, Co-Author`), title prefix collision after colon→underscore substitution, and zero-match disambiguation edge cases.

**~6,719 missing-file-repair unresolved** — books whose organizer-root paths cannot be found
anywhere (not in iTunes, not as flat M4B). Many are likely Deluge-only files not yet imported.

- [x] **RELINK-1** Apply 13 manual path fixes from the report — bot-task spec: [`docs/superpowers/bot-tasks/2026-04-29-relink-manual-fixes.md`](docs/superpowers/bot-tasks/2026-04-29-relink-manual-fixes.md) — 9 fixed via API, 4 absent from iTunes (results: `docs/reports/relink-manual-fixes-result-2026-04-29.md`)
- [x] **RELINK-2** Co-author dir matching: tries all dirs where author's surname appears — implemented at `maintenance_fixups.go:4154`
- [x] **RELINK-3** Title prefix colon→underscore normalization — implemented at `maintenance_fixups.go:4257`
- [x] **RELINK-4** `GET /api/v1/maintenance/relink-report` re-runs dry-run with why_unresolved annotations — PR #555
- [x] **RELINK-5** Bulk-import Deluge files into library for the ~6,719 that are Deluge-only — depends on Deluge Protected Paths (see below) — PR #563

## 📡 Activity Feed — Follow-up Gaps

PRs #509, #518, #521 wired batch logging + EmitInfo summaries + no-op tag filtering for
the four scheduler-driven maintenance ops. A few gaps remain:

- [x] **ACT-1** series-normalize EmitInfo (dedup-scan/author-dedup-scan already covered) — PR #547
- [x] **ACT-2** `info` tier in default-on tier filter — PR #539
- [x] **ACT-3** Batch noun for `isbn-enrich` — implemented at `batcher.go:211`

---

## 🏷️ Audible Category Ladders → Book Tags

Audible's `category_ladders` response group returns a full hierarchy per book,
e.g. `Audible Books > Science Fiction > Space Opera`. Each layer should be
applied as a user tag on the book so browsing by genre is hierarchical, not flat.

- [x] **CAT-1** category_ladders parsed into CategoryTags + AddBookTagWithSource("audible_category") in apply pipeline — PR #548
- [x] Parse ladder entries into `BookMetadata.CategoryTags []string` (all layers, e.g. `["Science Fiction", "Space Opera"]`) — PR #548
- [x] In the apply pipeline, write each tag via `AddBookTagWithSource` (idempotent) with source `"audible_category"` — PR #548
- [x] UI: show Audible-sourced category tags separately from user tags in the book detail panel — PR #561
- [ ] Search/filter: "has tag Science Fiction" or browsable tag cloud on library page

## 🤖 OpenAI Responses API Migration

Chat Completions is in maintenance; new models (gpt-5.4, codex-mini, the
o-series at full effort) ship on `/v1/responses` first or only. Plus
`PreviousResponseID` keeps history server-side, which collapses the
prompt-token cost for our multi-turn flows. Six phases sequenced
lowest-risk first; each phase ships independently and soaks before the
next picks up. Full plan in
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-responses-api-migration-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-responses-api-migration-design.md).

- [ ] **AI-RESP-A** [hold] Migrate `metadata_llm_review.go` (single call) — design spec linked above
- [ ] **AI-RESP-B** [hold] Migrate `openai_parser.go` single-shot calls (6 sites) — depends on A clean
- [ ] **AI-RESP-C** [hold] **DO NOT MIGRATE EMBEDDINGS** — `/v1/embeddings` stays as-is. This entry is here only to make the bot aware not to touch `embedding_client.go`.
- [ ] **AI-RESP-D** [hold] Migrate Batches API (`openai_batch.go`) once OpenAI supports `/v1/responses` URLs in batch lines — verify endpoint allowlist before pickup
- [ ] **AI-RESP-E** [hold] Migrate `aijobs/aijobs.go` multi-turn flows — adds `last_response_id` to job state; biggest token win
- [ ] **AI-RESP-F** [hold] Cleanup: delete remaining Chat Completions call sites in `internal/ai/`

## 🩺 Diagnostics & Visibility

- [x] **DIAG-1** Fix `ApiError: store does not implement AIJobsStore` on Diagnostics page — `AIJobsStore` interface (`iface_misc.go:255-265`) has no methods implemented in `sqlite_store.go` or `pebble_store.go`; crash occurs when `batch_poller` asserts `s.Store().(database.AIJobsStore)` — PR #570
- [x] **DIAG-2** Expand Diagnostics to surface DB health — SQLite table row counts, PebbleDB key counts, embeddings DB stats, `ai_scans.db` stats, recently-rejected metadata with reasons, `metadata_fetch` cache hit/miss/age — PR #570
- [x] **DIAG-3** Surface `ai_scans.db` and `embeddings.db` stats in Diagnostics — both are opened in `server.go:934-1004` but never shown on the diagnostics or system-info pages — PR #570
- [x] **DIAG-4** Increase `MetadataFetchCacheTTLDays` default — metadata_fetch cache TTL (configured via `config.AppConfig.MetadataFetchCacheTTLDays`) is expiring too fast; increased default to 30 days — PR #570
- [x] **DIAG-5** Add path-prefix diagnostic to Storage page UI — `GET /api/v1/diagnostics/db-health` now returns `book_path_prefixes`; surface this in StorageTab so mismatches between configured import paths and actual stored paths are visible without a separate API call
- [x] **CACHE-FOLLOWUP-1** Metadata-fetch cache TTL enforcement — `GetCachedMetadataFetchWithMaxAge` centralizes the TTL check and emits `metrics.RecordCacheMiss("metadata_fetch","expired")`; `GetCachedMetadataFetch` is a backward-compat maxAge=0 wrapper; all 7 non-test callers updated; 3 new TTL unit tests — PR feat/metadata-fetch-ttl

---

## 🖥️ System Page Cleanup

- [x] **SYS-1** Remove duplicate log viewer from System page — System page uses `/system/logs` (a different endpoint and data model from Activity); replace with a navigation link to the Activity page
- [x] **SYS-2** Fix Storage page showing 0 books for `/mnt/bigdata/books/newbooks` — removed `is_primary_version` filter from `GetAllImportPaths` live subquery; added `GetBookPathPrefixes` diagnostic — PR #572

---

## 🔍 Data Quality & Matching Improvements

- [x] **MATCH-1** Deduplicate books by metadata URL/response hash — `metadata_source_hash` column added to `books` (migration 055); `sha256("{source}:{canonical_id}")` populated on metadata apply; duplicate count surfaced in BookDetail — PR #573
- [x] **MATCH-2** Consolidate multi-file chapter books by duration — files with sequential naming (`01 - Book`, `02 - Book`, etc.) that are individually very short (< 10 min each) should be pre-consolidated into a single book entry using cumulative duration rather than treated as separate books
- [x] **MATCH-3** Use duration as metadata scoring signal — boost metadata candidates whose Audible `runtime_length_min` roughly matches local file total duration; combine with existing title/author/series scoring for much higher confidence matches
- [x] **MATCH-4** Deduplicate on same-metadata-hash at import time — when a new book is scanned and its computed `metadata_source_hash` matches an existing book, flag as potential duplicate via dedup candidate (PR #1080). Computes hash at import time based on metadata source (audible/openlibrary/google_books/hardcover) + external ID; creates candidate with layer `metadata_hash_match` + similarity 1.0; logs "import: metadata hash duplicate detected"

---

## 🔐 File Identity & SHA Tracking

- [x] **FILE-SHA-1** Pre-metadata-write SHA capture — `original_file_hash` recorded before any tag write; `post_metadata_hash` column added to `book_files` (migration 053); `UpdateBookFileHashes()` wired around all write-back paths — PR #571
- [x] **FILE-SHA-2** Cross-folder duplicate detection via SHA — use `original_file_hash` to identify identical files across different library paths (e.g. same file in iTunes + Deluge + organized); surface as consolidation candidates in the dedup UI

---

## 🗃️ Rejected Metadata Store

- [x] **META-REJ-1** Rejected metadata tracking — `metadata_rejections` table (migration 054); `RejectedMetadataStore` interface; SQLiteStore + PebbleStore implementations; `GET /api/v1/audiobooks/:id/metadata-rejections` endpoint; rejection history collapsible section in BookDetail UI — PR #571

---

## 🖼️ UX Polish — Spacing & Layout

- [x] **UX-FOOTER** Footer spacer on every page — `MainLayout.tsx` now renders a 56px `aria-hidden` spacer after `{children}` so content never bumps the bottom edge of the viewport

---

## 🔄 Async Backfill Operations — Queue, Bell, Resume

All backfill handlers currently run **synchronously inside the HTTP request**. If the server
restarts mid-run they silently stop and will not auto-resume. They also don't appear in Active
Operations or the notification bell. These need the same treatment as `composer_tag_scan` and
`missing-file-repair`: `s.queue.Enqueue` → `operations.SaveParams` → `SaveCheckpoint` loop →
`activity.EmitInfo` summary on finish.

- [ ] **BACKFILL-ASYNC-1** `handleBackfillFileHashes` — convert to async queued operation:
  - `operations.BackfillFileHashesParams{DryRun bool}` struct in `state.go`
  - Enqueue as `"backfill-file-hashes"`, return `opID` immediately
  - Worker loop: for each `book_file` missing hash, `SaveCheckpoint` every N files
  - On restart: `LoadCheckpoint` → skip already-processed file IDs (by index or file_id cursor)
  - `activity.EmitInfo` summary on completion; `activity.LogBatch` for errors
  - Poll via `GET /api/v1/operations/{id}`; UI "Backfill Missing Hashes" button uses opID

- [ ] **BACKFILL-ASYNC-2** `handleBackfillMetadataSourceHash` — same async treatment:
  - `operations.BackfillMetadataHashParams{DryRun bool, Force bool}` struct
  - Enqueue as `"backfill-metadata-source-hash"`, return `opID`
  - Worker: iterate all books, checkpoint every N; skip-on-resume by `PhaseIndex`
  - `activity.EmitInfo` + `activity.LogBatch` on finish

- [ ] **BACKFILL-ASYNC-3** [hold] `MetadataHashDuplicateCard` UI — add coverage stats panel + backfill button matching the SHA Duplicate Detection card style:
  - `GET /maintenance/metadata-hash-stats` endpoint: total books, with/without `metadata_source_hash`, by-library breakdown
  - `BookMetadataHashStats` struct in `store.go`; `GetBookMetadataHashStats` in interface + SQLite + PebbleDB + mock
  - Auto-load stats on mount; status chip ("N missing hashes" / "✓ All hashed"); "Backfill Missing Hashes" button
  - Make sure `metadata_source_hash` is set in every metadata-cache path (already set in `ApplyMetadataCandidate`; verify fetch-cache replay path sets it too)

---

## 🔐 File Provenance / Hash Chain

Track the full lifecycle of a file's hash so we can answer "has this file changed since download?".
Proposed chain: **DownloadHash** (as-downloaded) → **OriginalFileHash** (after iTunes/external tagger) → **FileHash** (current, after AO).

- [ ] **HASH-CHAIN-1** Add `download_hash` column to `book_files` (SQLite migration + PebbleDB field). Populate it from Deluge import data (already have `deluge_hash`) and allow manual set via API.
- [ ] **HASH-CHAIN-2** [hold] UI: show hash chain in book file detail view so users can see when/where a file changed.
- [ ] **HASH-CHAIN-3** Integrity alert: flag files where `file_hash != original_file_hash` and no AO tag-write is on record (possible external modification / bit-rot).

*Low priority — AcoustID fingerprinting covers the identity-across-re-encode case better. Useful mainly for strict download-integrity auditing.*

---

## 🎵 AcoustID / Audio Fingerprinting — Stats & Trigger UI

AcoustID segment fingerprints already exist in the schema (`acoustid_seg0`–`seg6`). Needs the same coverage-stats + backfill-trigger treatment as file hashes.

- [ ] **ACOUSTID-STATS-1** `GetAcoustIDStats()` — count books/files with ≥1 fingerprint segment populated, by-library breakdown. Add to interface + SQLite + PebbleDB + mock.
- [ ] **ACOUSTID-STATS-2** `GET /maintenance/acoustid-stats` handler + route.
- [ ] **ACOUSTID-STATS-3** UI card on Maintenance tab (same tile style as SHA Duplicate Detection): shows coverage %, "Fingerprint Library" trigger button, status chip.
- [x] **ACOUSTID-DEDUP-1** Acoustic Duplicates tab in BookDedup — fingerprint-based candidate pairs with similarity scores (PR #998)
- [x] **ACOUSTID-COMPARE-1** Manual two-book fingerprint comparison — `GET /api/v1/acoustid/compare?a=&b=` with per-segment Hamming distance; comparison panel in UI (PR #999)
  - Both books/files displayed side-by-side (title, author, cover, duration, format)
  - Overall similarity score (0–100%)
  - Per-segment diff: seg0 (intro), seg1–5 (body), seg6 (outro) — each segment shown as a colored match/mismatch bar with its individual score
  - Clear visual indication of which segments match, which differ, and by how much

Statuses below reflect the current state including v0.206.0's shipped
work (many items marked "open" in the backlog file were quietly shipped
since it was last edited on 2026-04-11).

### 1. Dedup & Library Integrity — [section](docs/backlog-2026-04-10.md#1-dedup--library-integrity)

- [x] **1.7** Per-side "merge into this" quick action (#230)
- [x] **1.8** Smarter "split cluster" with edge preview (#233)
- [x] **1.9** Series-aware bulk merge (#232)
- [x] **1.10** Export dedup state as CSV/JSON (#231)
- [x] **1.11** **Async embed via OpenAI Batch API for nightly re-scans** — `dedup.embed-async` UOS op (nightly cron 03:00) + `POST /api/v1/dedup/embed-async` on-demand trigger; batch poller handles result ingestion (PR #1003)
- [ ] **1.12** **Tag operation log lines with the originating operation ID** — pipe `op.ID` into a context-bound logger, replace bare `log.Printf` inside operation funcs with op-scoped calls, and write each line into `operation_logs` so the Activity-page log view shows everything (ffmpeg warnings, fingerprint failures, etc.) instead of only the explicit `progress.Log()` calls. Spec: [`docs/superpowers/bot-tasks/2026-05-04-tag-operation-logs.md`](docs/superpowers/bot-tasks/2026-05-04-tag-operation-logs.md)
- [x] **1.13** **Broken-files dashboard card + repair pipeline** — `book_file_errors` table, dashboard card, `has_file_errors` library facet, repair pipeline (PR #986)
- [x] **1.14** **Unified Operations System (UOS)** — COMPLETE 2026-05-11 (infra 2026-05-08, full migration 2026-05-11, final queue deletion PR #800). All 16 UOS tasks shipped across PRs #740–#759; v1→v2 `queue.Enqueue` migration completed across PRs #783–#798; BridgeQueue + OperationQueue + Queue interface fully deleted in PR #800. `scheduler_triggers.go` deleted; iTunes path ops and organizer scan decoupled from BridgeQueue via new `itunes_path_ops.go` and `ScanEnqueuer` callback. Single `Registry` owns every OperationDef; plugins register through `pkg/plugin/sdk`; subprocess isolation; explicit `ResumePolicy`; single SSE-fed frontend store. Human spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-04-unified-operations-system.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-04-unified-operations-system.md).
  - [x] **UOS-01** Schema migrations for v2 tables (merged 2026-05-06)
  - [x] **UOS-02** Registry shell + dispatcher + in-process worker pool (PR #741, merged 2026-05-06)
  - [x] **UOS-03** Reporter DB writes + subprocess runner (PR #745, merged 2026-05-06)
  - [x] **UOS-04** Public plugin SDK at `pkg/plugin/sdk` + import lint tool (PR #746, merged 2026-05-06)
  - [x] **UOS-05** Frontend dual-source operations store (PR #740, merged 2026-05-06)
  - [x] **UOS-06** SSE EventHub + /operations/timeline + introspection endpoints (PR #748, merged 2026-05-06)
  - [x] **UOS-07** Canary — migrate `dedup.embed-scan` as the first live plugin op (PR #747, merged 2026-05-06)
  - [x] **UOS-08** Watchdog + op_strikes_v2 + startup resume orchestration (PR #744, merged 2026-05-06)
  - [x] **UOS-09** Migrate AcoustID + remaining dedup ops to UOS (PR #750, merged 2026-05-08)
  - [x] **UOS-10** Migrate iTunes plugin (5 ops) to UOS (PR #753, merged 2026-05-08)
  - [x] **UOS-11** Migrate Deluge plugin (3 ops) to UOS (PR #752, merged 2026-05-08)
  - [x] **UOS-12** Migrate 26 maintenance ops to UOS plugin (PR #751, merged 2026-05-08)
  - [x] **UOS-13** Frontend single-source — drop dual-source (PR #754, merged 2026-05-08)
  - [x] **UOS-14** Delete v1 OperationQueue + legacy endpoints (PR #756, merged 2026-05-08)
  - [x] **UOS-15** Promote pkg/plugin/sdk to stable public API + sdkguard CI (PR #755, merged 2026-05-08)
- [ ] **1.15** [hold] **UOS amendment — `Reporter.SetCurrentItem(label)` for live "currently working on" ticker** — Sonarr/Radarr-style high-frequency current-item display under the progress bar. New SDK Reporter method that's purely ephemeral (in-memory on the registry's run handle, no DB write); SSE event `op.current_item` patches the frontend store; timeline endpoint returns the cached value so refresh / new tab / re-login re-hydrates. Survives refresh; survives a brief gap on server restart (next per-item iteration repopulates). If we ever want it to survive restart, retrofit is a single column add to `operations_v2` flushed at 30s cadence — explicit out of v1. Implementation footprint: amend §1 (Reporter) + §9 (timeline payload) + UOS-03/UOS-06 bot-tasks. Spec: [`docs/superpowers/bot-tasks/2026-05-05-uos-amendment-current-item.md`](docs/superpowers/bot-tasks/2026-05-05-uos-amendment-current-item.md).
- [~] **1.16** **Resizable + dynamically-sortable columns everywhere** — Library/Authors/Series/Works/TrashedVersions done (PR #1002). Remaining: dedup results, activity log, iTunes write-back preview, metadata review. Build a single `<ResizableSortableTable>` component (or extend existing `ConfigurableTable`); roll across remaining pages.
- [ ] **1.17** **Replace "AO" / "audiobook-organizer" branding with a real product name + logo** — the placeholder "AO" leaks into UI labels (e.g. proposed "AO Path" column on the iTunes write-back dialog), service names, status panels, etc. Pick a product name + minimal logo, apply consistently. Out of scope until name is decided; this entry is the placeholder for the rename sweep.

### 8. Out of Scope / Decide Later — [section](docs/backlog-2026-04-10.md#8-out-of-scope--decide-later)

Intentionally deferred. Captured here so they don't resurface as new ideas.

- iOS / Android companion app (scope explosion)
- WebDAV browse of the library (niche)
- RSS / Atom feed of new additions (niche)
- Notification system (Slack / Discord when scan completes) (rabbit hole)
- Cross-library federation (architecturally premature)
- Voice control / Alexa skill (out of focus)
- Audio preview in dedup tab — play first 30 seconds (requires streaming infra)
- "Recommended for you" based on listening history (no listening history store)
- Book recommendation engine (same)

## 🧠 From Memory — items not yet in the backlog file

These surfaced in later sessions and live only in Claude project memory.
Promote to `docs/backlog-2026-04-10.md` (or a successor) when touched.

### Graceful File Ops — 1 remaining gap

Full details: [`memory/project_graceful_file_ops.md`](../../.claude/projects/-Users-jdfalk-repos-github-com-jdfalk-audiobook-organizer/memory/project_graceful_file_ops.md)

- [x] **GFO-1** UI indicator for in-flight file ops + `GET /api/v1/file-ops/pending` (#270)
- [x] **GFO-2** Per-book tracking key collision — moved to `pending_file_op:{bookID}:{opType}` (#270)
- [x] **GFO-3** Resumable ops — `bulk_write_back`, `isbn-enrichment`, `metadata-refresh` (#270), `reconcile_scan` (#272). ~13 cleanup/maintenance types still silently fail on restart but are low-impact.
- [x] **GFO-4** Phase checkpoints in apply pipeline — rename/tags/itunes phases skip on recovery
- [x] **GFO-5** `GET /operations/recent` ~900ms — fixed by replacing O(N²) bubble sort with `sort.Slice` (#270). Side-index deferred until benchmarks show it's needed.

### Series Name Normalization — shipped

- [x] **SNR-1** `StripSeriesContamination` pure function — strips dash-embedded title/position and trailing ordinal words from series names (`internal/metadata/series_normalize.go`)
- [x] **SNR-2** Ingest gates — `NormalizeMetaSeries`, `resolveSeriesID`, `ensureSeriesID` all call `StripSeriesContamination` before any store write
- [x] **SNR-3** `GET /api/v1/series/normalize/preview` — dry-run preview of rename/merge actions
- [x] **SNR-4** `POST /api/v1/series/normalize` — async remediation: rename → merge → write-back → organize
- [x] **SNR-5** `series_normalize` maintenance task registered in scheduler (manual-only)

### Bulk Metadata Review — Audible series format bug

Full details: [`memory/project_bulk_metadata_review.md`](../../.claude/projects/-Users-jdfalk-repos-github-com-jdfalk-audiobook-organizer/memory/project_bulk_metadata_review.md)

- [x] **BMR-1** Audible "Series, Book N" baked into series field — `normalizeMetaSeries` now runs in `ApplyMetadataCandidate` too, not just the auto-fetch paths (#271)

### Async Operations — Unified Maintenance System (✅ COMPLETE)

Unified Maintenance System shipped 2026-05-11 via `internal/server/maintenance_dispatcher.go`. All 28
`maintenance.Job` implementations in `internal/maintenance/jobs/` are accessible via
`POST /maintenance/jobs/:job_id` → enqueues as UOS op → returns `{ operation_id }`.

- [x] **ASYNC-0** Frontend: toast notifications for operation lifecycle — PR #499
- [x] **ASYNC-CORE-1** `MaintenanceJob` interface + registry — completed (`internal/maintenance/`)
- [x] **ASYNC-CORE-2** Dispatcher `POST /maintenance/jobs/:id` + resume — completed (`maintenance_dispatcher.go`)
- [x] **ASYNC-CORE-3** Frontend API client (`listMaintenanceJobs`, `runMaintenanceJob`) — completed
- [x] **ASYNC-CORE-4** Dynamic "Manual Fixes" section in MaintenanceTab — completed (`ManualFixesCard`)
- [x] **ASYNC-W1-1** Convert `fix-read-by-narrator` — ✅ `fix_read_by_narrator.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-W1-2** Convert `cleanup-series` — ✅ `cleanup_series.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-W1-3** Convert `fix-author-narrator-swap` — ✅ `fix_author_narrator_swap.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-W1-4** Convert `fix-version-groups` — ✅ `fix_version_groups.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-W2-1** Convert `backfill-book-files` — ✅ `backfill_book_files.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-W2-2** Convert `cleanup-empty-folders` — ✅ `cleanup_empty_folders.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-W2-3** Convert `cleanup-organize-mess` — ✅ `cleanup_organize_mess.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-W2-4** Convert `fix-library-states` — ✅ `fix_library_states.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-W3-1** Convert `enrich-book-files` — ✅ `enrich_book_files.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-W3-2** Convert `dedup-books` — ✅ `dedup_books.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-W3-3** Convert `fix-book-file-paths` — ✅ `fix_book_file_paths.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-W3-4** Convert `refetch-missing-authors` — ✅ `refetch_missing_authors.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-W3-5** Convert `recompute-itunes-paths` — ✅ `recompute_itunes_paths.go`
- [x] **ASYNC-CLEAN-1** Remove old synchronous maintenance routes — done (server.go 6400→581 lines)

### Design Spec Already Written (but not yet planned)

- [x] **DES-1** Bleve library search — complete 6/7 (#298, #301-#302, #311-#312, #321)
- [x] **DES-2** chromem-go embedding store — #351 (store impl + tests; dedup engine wiring follows)

## ✅ Recently Completed

### Session 23 (2026-04-29) — metadata pipeline + activity feed + ratings (#507–#521)

**15 PRs merged** across one session:

- **#507** `feat(relink)`: iTunes relink endpoint — 3-tier path resolver (same-dir M4B → flat iTunes search → disambiguation), dir-grouping, 94.7% success on ~8K broken paths. 13 unresolved cases documented in `docs/reports/unresolved-relinks-2026-04-28.md`.
- **#508** `feat(metadata)`: async resumable bulk-fetch-metadata for full library
- **#509** `fix(activity)`: wire `LogBatch` into purge-deleted, isbn-enrichment, temp-file-cleanup, missing-file-repair; rename `missing_file_repair` → `missing-file-repair` (dash consistency)
- **#510** `fix(mocks)`: add missing `GetAllBookFiles` typed expecter to `MockStore` (unblocked `TestMockStore_Coverage`)
- **#511** `fix(maintenance)`: `revert-metadata-fetch` endpoint
- **#512** `fix(metadata)`: bulk-fetch-metadata no longer auto-applies
- **#513** `feat(metadata)`: `prefer_audible` and `skip_cached` options for bulk-fetch
- **#514** `fix(audible)`: json/v2 compat — `DiscardUnknownMembers` + nullable `RuntimeLengthMin`
- **#515** `feat(audible)`: map `runtime_length_min` → `DurationSec` → `Book.Duration`
- **#516** `feat(ratings)`: full Audible (5 dims + count + reviews) + Google Books (rating + count) rating dimensions ingested and stored
- **#517** `feat(db)`: reserve user rating columns (`user_rating_overall/story/performance/notes`) on `books` table
- **#518** `fix(activity)`: emit EmitInfo summary entries so maintenance ops show content in activity log (not just start/complete)
- **#519** `fix(ui)`: MetadataReviewDialog refresh, regex filter, correct pagination + Deluge timeout fix
- **#520** `feat(scoring)`: duration-based candidate ranking from Audible runtime
- **#521** `feat(activity)`: no-op tag filtering — `EmitInfo` variadic tags, `NoOpTag`/`TagsIf` helpers, `ExcludeTags` SQL + HTTP param, frontend "hide no-op" chip (default on)

Missing-file-repair scan results: **9,034 fixed**, 36 ambiguous, **6,719 unresolved** (see RELINK-5).
CI: disabled Docker in prerelease workflow (was exhausting 14GB GitHub runner disk).

<details>
<summary>Session 12-19 archive — click to expand</summary>

### Bugs — Session 15 (March 25-27, 2026) — all fixed
- **B1** Author merge variant display — shows merge target + all variant names
- **B2** Tag extraction conflicting metadata — composer cleared on write
- **B3** Author/narrator swap — mitigated by B2; full fix needs metadata pipeline redesign (7.11 covered the worst of it)
- **B4** `series_index` not read back — already fixed (reads `SERIES_INDEX` / `MVIN`)
- **B5** 35 iTunes sync path errors — not a bug, files genuinely missing on disk
- **B6** File version separator too faint — thicker separator
- **B7** Book detail refresh after metadata — refresh button + auto-refresh after operations
- **B8** Write-back fails on multi-file books — globs audio files in directory

### P0 / P1 — all resolved
- **1** ISBN enrichment wrong matches — 60% length ratio fix validated
- **2** Preview Organize (single book) — built with step-by-step preview + Apply
- **3** Playlist system — assessed, needs brainstorming (tracked as 3.4 above)
- **4** Bulk "Save to Files" — `POST /api/v1/audiobooks/bulk-write-back`
- **5** Series dedup cleanup — `POST /api/v1/maintenance/cleanup-series`
- **6** "read by narrator" fix — `POST /api/v1/maintenance/fix-read-by-narrator` (dry-run default)
- **7** M4B conversion live test — local tests pass; production test user-gated

### P2 items 8-29 (April 6, 2026 session) — all fixed
Activity page mobile layout, adaptive refresh, version vs snapshot UI polish, compare snapshot wiring, background ISBN enrichment, copy-on-write TTL tuning, iTunes PID detail view, ITL write-back testing, TAG-DIAG cleanup, author/narrator swap full fix, library state badges, Vite chunk splitting, stale interrupted operations, sticky settings buttons, iTunes sync dialog pre-fill, iTunes sync from ITL directly, Force Import greyed out, ITL multi-file books, Files & History separate version boxes, show individual files, track PIDs sorted, XML function deprecation.

### Active P1 items 30-33 (April 6, 2026) — resolved or partial
- **30** Background file ops graceful tracking — persistent PebbleDB tracking + startup recovery. Five follow-up gaps captured under **GFO-1..5** above.
- **31** Resume interrupted metadata fetch on startup — saves book_ids as params, resumes remaining
- **32** Aggressive search/book result caching — list 30s, metadata search 30s
- **33** Batch apply separate requests per click — partially fixed (500ms debounce); true client-side queue still open

### CI/CD & Lint Fixes (April 6, 2026)
- **34** E2E test lint errors — 15 fixes across 12 files
- **35** Frontend lint warnings — proper types, targeted eslint-disable
- **36** GitHub Actions Node.js 20 deprecation — `setup-node` already at v6.3.0; transitive updates ongoing

## 2026-05-01 Re-Audit Bot Tasks

Findings from the 2026-05-01 re-audit. See `docs/codebase-evaluation.md` §Re-Audit for evidence.

### High Priority

- [x] **TEST-1** Done: actual failures were missing `context.Context` args from CTX-3 (not PROJ-1/2); fixed `internal/fileops/service_test.go` and `internal/server/service_layer_test.go` — both packages now pass.
  Spec: `docs/superpowers/bot-tasks/2026-05-01-test-1-fix-audiobook-service-tests.md`

- **TEST-2** Fix `TestStoreAdditionalCoverageSQLite` failure in `internal/database` package  
  Spec: `docs/superpowers/bot-tasks/2026-05-01-test-2-fix-database-test-coverage.md`

### Medium Priority

- **DEP-1** Overview: migrate ~34 deprecated `Book.ITunesPath` usages across 4 packages to `BookFile.ITunesPath` (SA1019). See sub-tasks below.
