## Metadata Sources

- [x] Hardcover.app integration
- [x] Google Books API key support (config, persistence, credentials map, env var)
- [x] Cover art: automatic download to local disk
- [x] Cover art: embed in audio file metadata tags (ffmpeg/metaflac, graceful fallback)

## Search Quality

- [x] Title cleaning: bracket stripping for "[Series] Title" format
- [x] Title cleaning: part/volume/chapter pattern removal
- [x] Title cleaning: subtitle stripping (colon, dash, em-dash separators)
- [x] Author-only fallback search with best-title-match scoring
- [x] Fuzzy search / Levenshtein distance matching
- [x] Search result ranking/scoring (0-100 fuzzy score, best match first)

## Infrastructure

- [x] PebbleDB format version logging on startup
- [x] PebbleDB v2 upgrade (v2.1.4, all imports migrated to v2 path)
- [x] Docker deployment (multi-stage build, docker-compose, Makefile targets)
- [x] launchd/systemd service files (macOS plist + Linux systemd unit with install scripts)
- [x] File watching / auto-scan for new audiobooks (fsnotify watcher with debounce)

## Data Quality

- [x] Metadata undo/history (MetadataChangeRecord, UI component)
- [x] Directory-as-filepath bug in tag extraction — fixed, falls back to filename parsing
- [x] Basic auth for web UI (constant-time compare, health/static exemptions)

## 🤖 CI/CD Workflow Actionization

Managed via background agent queue. See [Release & DevOps](docs/plans/release-packaging-and-devops.md) for details.

1. Plan security workflow actionization
2. Audit remaining workflows for action conversion
3. Validate new composite actions CI/CD pipelines
4. Verify action tags and releases
5. Update reusable workflows to use new actions
