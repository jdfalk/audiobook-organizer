# Audiobook Organizer — Additional Copilot Context

Org-wide coding standards (file headers, Go/TS rules, commit format) are at
**https://github.com/falkcorp/.github** and apply automatically to this repo.

This file contains audiobook-organizer-specific additions only.
For full project context see **CLAUDE.md** at the repo root.

## Project overview

Go 1.24 backend (Gin) + React 18/TypeScript frontend (Material UI).
DB: PebbleDB (primary), NutsDB (activity log). SQLite removed Jun 2026.
Integration: Open Library, AcoustID fingerprinting, OpenAI batch API.

## Critical constraints

- `UpdateBook` does **full column replacement** — always supply all fields.
- iTunes XML path must **never** be scanned by the file scanner.
- Production is Linux (`make deploy`). Do not use macOS-specific commands.
- Worktree discipline: never commit directly to `main`. All changes via PRs.

## Dedup architecture

### Candidate emission gate (`hasPlausibleAudio`)

`internal/dedup/engine.go` — `hasPlausibleAudio(book *database.Book) bool`
returns true when `Duration > 0` OR `FileSize >= 256 KiB` (256 × 1024 bytes).

The `checkExactTitle` and `checkExactISBN` emitters call this gate for **both
sides** of a pair before emitting a `DedupCandidate`. This prevents stub or
unscanned books (zero duration, zero file size) from being emitted as candidates
and flooding the review queue with false positives.

`checkExactAcoustID` is **intentionally NOT gated** — an AcoustID match is
itself sufficient evidence of audio content.

### Labeled training dataset

The dataset subsystem lives in two packages:

- **`internal/database/dedup_label.go`** — PebbleDB keyspace `dedup:label:`.
  Stores `LabeledExample` records: candidate pair + per-book feature snapshots
  (`BookFeatures`) + label fields (`label`, `label_source`, `label_reason`,
  `decided_at`). Empty `label` means unlabeled (features only, for future ML).

- **`internal/dedup/dataset/`** — pure package; no DB side effects.
  - `BuildExample` computes: duration ratio, folder relation (unrelated /
    same_dir / a_ancestor_of_b / b_ancestor_of_a), recording-ID overlap,
    whole-book signature relation (unknown / match / disjoint).
  - `Classify` runs three deterministic catchers in priority order:
    1. `wholeBookSignatureMatch` → `true_dup` (positive oracle; similarity ≥ 0.95)
    2. `missingFile` → `not_dup` (never merge a book with no files)
    3. `partVsWhole` → `not_dup` (duration ratio < 0.5 with both durations known)

### Backfill op

`internal/plugins/dedup/dataset_backfill.go` — `dedup.dataset-backfill` UOS op.
Dry-run by default; `apply=true` writes labeled examples and dismisses
rule-confirmed `not_dup` candidates (status → `dismissed`). Idempotent.

Known gap: pairs where one side has `Duration=0` but file records exist are NOT
caught by the current catchers; they remain unlabeled. The engine gate stops NEW
such pairs; a future FileSize-aware catcher will handle the existing residual.
