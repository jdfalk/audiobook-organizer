# Audiobook Organizer - Technical Design Document

## Overview

Audiobook Organizer is a command-line application and lightweight HTTP API
server designed to help users organize their audiobook collections by
identifying series, generating playlists, and updating audio file metadata. The
application scans audiobook files, extracts metadata, uses pattern matching and
fuzzy logic to identify series relationships, and persists information using a
pluggable storage layer.

Key capabilities:

- CLI workflows for scan, organize, playlist generation, and tagging
- HTTP API under `/api/v1` for listing/updating audiobooks, works, folders,
  backups, and metadata ops
- Safe operations philosophy (copy-first, backups for file writes)

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of
concerns:

## Key Components

### Command Interface (cmd)

Uses Cobra and Viper to provide a flexible and powerful CLI:

- **root**: Main command with global flags and configuration
- **scan**: Scans directories for audiobooks and processes metadata
- **playlist**: Generates playlists for identified series
- **tag**: Updates audio file metadata with series information
- **organize**: Convenience command that runs all the above in sequence

### Configuration (internal/config)

Manages application settings using Viper:

- Loads from config files, environment variables, and command-line flags
- Supports paths to audiobook directories, database, playlist output
- Configures supported file extensions and external API keys

### Database (internal/database)

Pluggable persistence layer with two implementations:

- PebbleDB (default, recommended): embedded key-value store for production
- SQLite3 (opt-in): relational store for development/testing convenience

- **authors**: Stores author information
- **series**: Stores series information with author relationships
- **works**: Logical title-level grouping across editions/narrations/languages
- **books**: Stores book information with paths, formats, series/author links,
  and extended metadata (see below)
- **playlists**: Stores generated playlist information
- **playlist_items**: Stores the composition of playlists

Identifiers:

- ULID string IDs for books and works (stable, sortable) stored as TEXT in
  SQLite
- Integer IDs retained for authors, series, playlists to match existing schema

Extended Book fields:

- work_id, narrator, edition, language, publisher, isbn10, isbn13

### Scanner (internal/scanner)

Responsible for discovering and processing audiobook files:

- Walks directory structures to find supported audio files
- Extracts metadata and identifies series relationships
- Maps standard tags (title/artist/album) and, where available,
  narrator/language/publisher
- Establishes a Work association (by normalized title/author) when enabled
- Maps files to database entities

### Metadata (internal/metadata)

Extracts and processes metadata from audio files:

- Uses the `dhowden/tag` library to read standard tags
- Falls back to filename and path analysis when tags are missing
- Handles various audio formats including M4B, MP3, and others
- Provides batch validation/update utilities used by the API

### Matcher (internal/matcher)

Implements series identification algorithms:

- Pattern matching using regular expressions
- Directory structure analysis
- Fuzzy matching for similar titles using `lithammer/fuzzysearch`
- Keyword detection for series indicators

### Playlist (internal/playlist)

Generates playlists for audio applications:

- Creates M3U format playlists compatible with iTunes and other players
- Orders books by series sequence or title
- Sanitizes filenames and paths for cross-platform compatibility

### Tagger (internal/tagger)

Updates metadata tags in audio files:

- Adds or updates series information using format-specific tools
- Supports M4B/M4A/AAC (via AtomicParsley), MP3 (via eyeD3), and FLAC (via
  metaflac)
- Currently implemented as mock operations with actual commands commented

### HTTP Server (internal/server)

Exposes a JSON REST API used by the web UI (future) and external tools:

- Audiobooks: `GET /api/v1/audiobooks`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/audiobooks/:id`
- Works: `GET/POST /api/v1/works`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/works/:id`,
  `GET /api/v1/works/:id/books`
- Metadata: `POST /api/v1/metadata/batch-update`,
  `POST /api/v1/metadata/validate`, `GET /api/v1/metadata/export`,
  `POST /api/v1/metadata/import`
- Library folders, operations, backups, and system status endpoints

                                     +----------------+
```

Additional tables/keys:

- works (SQLite): id TEXT PK, title TEXT, author_id INT NULL, series_id INT
  NULL, alt_titles TEXT NULL, created_at, updated_at
- books (extensions): work_id TEXT NULL, narrator TEXT NULL, edition TEXT NULL,
  language TEXT NULL, publisher TEXT NULL, isbn10 TEXT NULL, isbn13 TEXT NULL

## Algorithmic Approach

### Series Identification

1. **Metadata Analysis**:
   - Extract standard metadata tags (artist, title, album)
   - Look for grouping/content group tags that might contain series info

2. **Pattern Matching**:
   - Regular expressions match common patterns like "Series Name - Book Title"
   - Identify book numbers in titles ("Book 1", "#1", "Vol. 1")

3. **Path Analysis**:
   - Extract information from directory names
   - Use author directory and subdirectories to infer series relationships

4. **Fuzzy Matching**:
   - Compare titles using fuzzy string matching to find similar patterns
   - Detect series keywords ("trilogy", "saga", "chronicles")

## Performance Considerations

- Progress bars for long-running operations
- Database transaction batching for bulk operations
- Parallel processing opportunities (currently sequential)
- Indexed queries for efficient database operations

## External Dependencies

- **spf13/cobra**: Command-line interface framework
- **spf13/viper**: Configuration management
- **mattn/go-sqlite3**: SQLite database driver
- **dhowden/tag**: Audio metadata extraction
- **lithammer/fuzzysearch**: Fuzzy string matching
- **schollz/progressbar**: Progress visualization

## Future Enhancements

1. **External API Integration**:
   - Integration with Goodreads or similar services for better series
     identification
   - Book database lookups to supplement metadata

2. **Improved Tag Writing**:
   - Direct tag writing implementation instead of external tool calls
   - Support for more audio formats

3. **Web Interface**:
   - Web UI for visualization and manual organization (server already exposes
     API)
   - Work and series relationship editing

4. **Advanced Matching**:
   - Machine learning-based title and series matching
   - User feedback loop to improve matching over time

5. **Additional Playlist Formats**:
   - Support for more playlist formats beyond M3U
   - Smart playlist generation based on listening habits

## Known Limitations

1. Tag writing is currently placeholder-only and requires external tools
2. No support for multi-author series
3. Limited handling of books that belong to multiple series
4. Fuzzy matching may produce false positives with similar titles
5. No handling of cover art or other media assets
6. PUT semantics replace full objects for updates; PATCH behavior may be added
   later

7. **Library Organization**:
   - Optionally create a structured library using hard links, reflinks, or
     copies
   - Support multiple layout styles including iTunes-compatible organization
