// CrossValidate compares groups scan suggestions against full scan suggestions.
// Returns unified ScanResults with agreement classification.
//
// Logic:
//   - For each groups suggestion, try to match against full suggestions by overlapping author IDs.
//     Fallback: match by canonical name.
//   - Match found + same action + same canonical -> "agreed" (use higher confidence)
//   - Match found + same action + different canonical -> "agreed" (use groups' canonical, note diff)
//   - Match found + different actions -> "disagreed" (include both)
//   - No match -> "groups_only"
//   - Unmatched full suggestions -> "full_only"
