// TestShutdown_WaitsForOpGoroutineToExit is the regression test for the
// test-suite data race + "pebble: closed" panic. Both shared one root cause:
// during shutdown, executeRun released the run handle (so Shutdown reported
// "all workers drained") BEFORE an abandoned op goroutine had actually exited.
// That goroutine then outlived the caller, racing the next test's global
// config write and writing to a closed store.
//
// This test registers an op that ignores context cancellation, calls Shutdown
// with an unbounded context, and asserts Shutdown does NOT return until the op
// goroutine has truly exited. It FAILS on the pre-fix code (Shutdown returns
// after AbandonGrace while the goroutine is still alive).
